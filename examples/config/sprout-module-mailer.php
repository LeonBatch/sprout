 * Mailer Module Config Overrides

 * This file is an example template for the available file-based config override settings.

 * To use file-based overrides, copy and rename this file:
 * From: vendor/barrelstrength/sprout/examples/config/sprout-module-mailer.php
 * To: craft/config/sprout-module-mailer.php
 *
 * Configure the settings as you desire. This config file can also be
 * setup as a multi-environment config just as Craft's config/general.php
 * and all settings here can be overridden by environment variables.
